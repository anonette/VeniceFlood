## Technical Achievements

### Infinite Loop Resolution
**Problem**: Original simulation experienced infinite cascade propagation loops
**Solution Implemented**:
```python
# Cascade Event Tracking System
if not hasattr(self, 'created_cascade_events'):
    self.created_cascade_events = set()

# Duplicate Prevention
event_key = f"cascade_{interdep.dependency_id}_{propagation_tick}"
if (event_key not in self.created_cascade_events and 
    len([e for e in self.cascade_events if e.event_id.startswith('cascade_')]) < 50):
```

**Results**:
- Maximum 50 cascade events per scenario (depth limiting)
- Unique event identifiers prevent duplicates
- Proper simulation termination achieved
- All 8 scenarios completed successfully

### System State Tracking
- **12 Critical Systems** monitored continuously
- **Real-time degradation** measurement (0.0 = failed, 1.0 = operational)
