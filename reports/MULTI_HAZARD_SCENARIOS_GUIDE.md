# Multi-Hazard Cyber-Physical Cascade Scenarios

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This framework extends the Venice Flat Ontology simulation to model complex **multi-hazard cyber-physical cascades**. Built on top of the proven Venice flood simulation, it enables testing of compound disasters where cyber attacks, infrastructure failures, and natural hazards interact through system interdependencies.

## ðŸŒŠ Key Innovation: Cyber-Physical Cascade Modeling

### **What Makes This Different**
- **Real Venice agents**: 115 authentic place-personas with actual coordinates and capabilities
- **Cyber-physical interdependencies**: Explicit modeling of how digital and physical systems interact
- **Dynamic cascade propagation**: Failures automatically cascade through dependent systems
- **Multi-hazard scenarios**: Compound events that unfold over time with realistic dependencies
- **Agent-level impacts**: Individual places experience different disruption effects

### **Core Cascade Concepts**
1. **System Interdependencies**: Power â†’ Pumps â†’ Digital Systems â†’ Communications
2. **Propagation Delays**: Realistic time for cascade effects to spread (1-5 ticks)
3. **Coupling Strength**: How tightly systems are connected (0.0 to 1.0)
4. **Failure Thresholds**: At what degradation point does one system affect another
5. **Bidirectional Effects**: Some dependencies work both ways
